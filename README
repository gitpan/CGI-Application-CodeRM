CGI::Application::CodeRM README File
===============================


Description
-----------

This module adds a possibility to the plain CGI::Application module: instead of
returning the output itself, a run mode can return a code reference that will
print the output on its own. The referenced code will be called after the printing
of the headers.

The main advantage is that you can avoid to charge the memory with the whole (and
sometime huge) output and print it while it is produced.

This is particularly useful if you are using Text::MagicTemplate and
HTML::MagicTemplate, that can print with minimum memory requirements, but you can
also use it with your own subroutines.
